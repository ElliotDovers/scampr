Description: Fit log-Gaussian Cox Process regression models to point patterns with
    extensions, including a joint model for integrating presence-only and
    presence/absence data. The models are fitted using maximum likelihood estimation
    via 'TMB' (Template Model Builder). Latent random Gaussian fields are approximated
    by 'FRK' (Fixed Rank Kriging) and are integrated out using either variational or
    Laplace approximation. Gradients are calculated using automatic differentiation.
